# WoodScape: A multi-task, multi-camera fisheye dataset for autonomous driving
The repository containing tools and information about the WoodScape dataset.

## Abstract
Fisheye cameras are commonly employed for obtaining a large field of view in surveillance, augmented reality and in particular automotive applications. In spite of its prevalence, there are few public datasets for detailed evaluation of computer vision algorithms on fisheye images. We release the first extensive fisheye automotive dataset, *WoodScape*, named after Robert Wood who invented the fisheye camera in 1906. *WoodScape* comprises of four surround view cameras and nine tasks including segmentation, depth estimation, 3D bounding box detection and soiling detection. Semantic annotation of 40 classes at the instance level is provided for over 10,000 images and annotation for other tasks are provided for over 100,000 images. We would like to encourage the community to adapt computer vision models for fisheye camera instead of naive rectification.
